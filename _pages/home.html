  <p>
    I am an engineer that aspires to build intelligent machines capable of performing any task a human can and more. 
    To do so, I seek to understand the key biological mechanisms underpinning biological intelligence. How do animals learn? 
    What neural architectures support this learning process? How can we reverse-engineer these mechanisms <em>in silico</em>? I aim to
    answer these questions. 
  </p>

<p>
  I am currently a Research Engineer in the Karalis Lab at the Paris Brain Institute, studying how neuromodulators shape population activity in 
  the brain. 
</p>
<p>Outside research, I like long runs, playing chess and classical music.</p>

      <h3>Dexterous robot manipulation</h3>
      <p>I am interested in applying neuroevolution to robotics, with a focus on dexterous manipulation. My goal is to evolve neural controllers that can acquire complex sensorimotor skills through continual self-supervised interaction with the environment.</p>
